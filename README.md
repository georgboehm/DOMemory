- **Description**: The session mode is where the real learning happens! Users can test themselves by answering questions on each card in the set. Initially, only the question is visible. Once they feel confident about their answer, they can flip the card to reveal the answer. Based on their response, they can categorize the card as "correctly answered" or "wrongly answered".

### Score and Stats Page

### Light and Dark Mode
- **Description**: For user convenience, the application offers both light and dark modes.
